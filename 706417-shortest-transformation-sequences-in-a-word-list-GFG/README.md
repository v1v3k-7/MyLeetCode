# [Shortest Transformation Sequences in a Word List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/word-ladder-ii/1)
## Hard
Given two distinct words s&nbsp;and e, and a list of unique words words[], where all words have the same length, find all shortest transformation sequences from s to e.
A valid transformation sequence must satisfy the following conditions:

Only one character can be changed in each transformation.
Every transformed word must exist in words[], including e.
All words consist only of lowercase English letters.
s may or may not be present in words[].

Return all shortest transformation sequences from s to e. If no such sequence exists, return an empty list. The sequences may be returned in any order.
Examples:
Input: s = "der", e = "dfs", words[] = ["des", "der", "dfr", "dgt", "dfs"]
Output: [["der", "des", "dfs"], ["der", "dfr", "dfs"]]
Explanation: There are two shortest transformation sequences from "der" to "dfs", each having a length of 3:
"der" -&gt; "dfr" -&gt; "dfs"
"der" -&gt; "des" -&gt; "dfs"
Each transformation changes exactly one character, and every intermediate word belongs to words[]. Since these are the shortest possible sequences, both are included in the output.

Input: s = "gedk", e = "geek", words[] = ["geek", "gefk"]
Output: [["gedk", "geek"]]Explanation: The word "gedk" can be transformed directly into "geek" by changing the third character ['d' to 'e']. Since "geek" is present in words[], the shortest transformation sequence is:
"gedk" -&gt; "geek"
Therefore, the output contains a single sequence.

Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 500, where n is the length of words.1 ≤ m ≤ 10, where m is the length of words[i]The sum of all shortest sequences does not exceed 105.&nbsp;Let k is the number of shortest transformation sequences.
