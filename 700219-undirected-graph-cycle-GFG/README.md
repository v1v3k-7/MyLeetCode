# [Undirected Graph Cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-an-undirected-graph/1)
## Medium
Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, represented as a 2D vector edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes an edge between vertices u and v, determine whether the graph contains a cycle or not. 
Note: The graph can have multiple component.
Examples:
Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 is a cycle.

Input: V = 4, E = 3, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
 No cycle in the graph.

Constraints:1 ≤ V, E ≤ 1050 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] &lt; V
