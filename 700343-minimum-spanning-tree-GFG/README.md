## Medium
Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph with V vertices and E edges, your task is to find the sum of the weights of the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph. The graph is provided as a list of edges, where each edge is represented as [u, v, w], indicating an edge between vertex u and vertex v with edge weight w.
Input: V = 3, E = 3, Edges = [[0, 1, 5], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 1]]
 Output: 4
Explanation:
The Spanning Tree resulting in a weight
of 4 is shown above.
Input: V = 2, E = 1, Edges = [[0 1 5]] Output: 5 Explanation: Only one Spanning Tree is possible which has a weight of 5.
Constraints:2 ≤ V ≤ 1000V-1 ≤ E ≤ (V*(V-1))/21 ≤ w ≤ 1000The graph is connected and doesn't contain self-loops &amp; multiple edges.
