# [Count Strongly Connected](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/strongly-connected-components-kosarajus-algo/1)
## Medium
Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges. The graph is represented as a 2D vector edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes a direct edge from vertex u to v.&nbsp;Find&nbsp;the number of strongly connected components in the graph.
Examples:
Input: V = 5, E = 5, edges[][] = [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 4]]

Output: 3
Explanation: We can clearly see that there are 3 Strongly Connected Components in the Graph.
&nbsp;
Input: V = 3, E = 3, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: All of the nodes are connected to each other. So, there's only one SCC.
Input: V = 2, E = 1, edges[][] = [[0, 1]]
Output: 2
Constraints:1 ≤ V ≤ 1060 ≤ E ≤ 1060 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] &lt; V
